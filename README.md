# **Boom It**
Boom It is a fast-paced space shooter where players must destroy incoming asteroids before time runs out. The game challenges players to make quick decisions, improve their reaction speed, and enjoy an engaging arcade-style experience.

## Gameplay
Players must register and log in to start playing.
The game consists of three levels, each increasing in difficulty.
Players control a spaceship that moves horizontally and shoots lasers to destroy asteroids.
Each asteroid has a point value representing its healthâ€”hitting it reduces its health, and destroying it increases the player's score.
If an asteroid reaches the bottom, it respawns with the same health.
If an asteroid hits the spaceship, the player's score decreases.
To win a level, the player must reach the required score before time runs out.
## Features
- Progression System: Increasing difficulty with more asteroid health, higher score requirements, and extended time per level.
- Leaderboard: Top 10 players with the highest scores and fastest completion times are displayed for each level.
- Sound & Music: Background music, sound effects for shooting and explosions, and adjustable volume in settings.
- User Menu: Access settings (music volume, battery status) and instructions on how to play.
## Target Audience
For players who enjoy action-packed arcade games with a strategic element.

## Development Motivation
Inspired by a childhood favorite, this project aims to recreate the classic asteroid shooter experience while enhancing problem-solving and reaction skills.
